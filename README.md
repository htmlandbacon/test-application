# test-application

Currently there is one file `app.js`, this contains the following

1. Two fake API calls, one get, one post

2. Get/Post renders for landing page, and create.

3. Light validation for username

Based on the above :-

1. Look at app.js to decide and implement a test strategy

- This should be test driven
- You can split up the code in anyway you like
- You can use both unit and intergration tests
- Think about the different areas you are testing

2. Using test driven development, update the /list route to get data from the backend

3. Remove the fake backend to talk to MongoDB or similar
